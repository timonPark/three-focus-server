# Monitoring and Analysis

## PostgreSQL Monitoring

### Essential Extensions

```sql
-- Install performance monitoring extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_buffercache;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;  -- For similarity searches

-- Reset statistics
SELECT pg_stat_statements_reset();
SELECT pg_stat_reset();
```

### Query Performance Tracking

```sql
-- Top queries by total time
SELECT
    substring(query, 1, 100) as short_query,
    round(total_exec_time::numeric, 2) as total_time_ms,
    calls,
    round(mean_exec_time::numeric, 2) as mean_time_ms,
    round(stddev_exec_time::numeric, 2) as stddev_ms,
    round((100 * total_exec_time / sum(total_exec_time) OVER ())::numeric, 2) as pct_total
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query NOT LIKE '%pg_stat_statements%'
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Queries with high variance
SELECT
    substring(query, 1, 100) as short_query,
    calls,
    round(mean_exec_time::numeric, 2) as mean_ms,
    round(stddev_exec_time::numeric, 2) as stddev_ms,
    round(max_exec_time::numeric, 2) as max_ms,
    round((stddev_exec_time / NULLIF(mean_exec_time, 0))::numeric, 2) as coeff_var
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE calls > 100
  AND stddev_exec_time > mean_exec_time * 0.5
ORDER BY stddev_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- I/O intensive queries
SELECT
    substring(query, 1, 100) as short_query,
    calls,
    shared_blks_hit,
    shared_blks_read,
    shared_blks_written,
    round((shared_blks_read::numeric / NULLIF(calls, 0)), 2) as reads_per_call,
    round((shared_blks_hit / NULLIF(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0)::numeric * 100), 2) as cache_hit_pct
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE shared_blks_read > 0
ORDER BY shared_blks_read DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Connection and Lock Monitoring

```sql
-- Current activity
SELECT
    pid,
    usename,
    application_name,
    client_addr,
    state,
    state_change,
    query_start,
    now() - query_start as duration,
    wait_event_type,
    wait_event,
    substring(query, 1, 100) as query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle'
ORDER BY query_start;

-- Blocking queries
SELECT
    blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
    blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,
    blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
    blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
    blocked_activity.query AS blocked_query,
    blocking_activity.query AS blocking_query,
    blocked_activity.application_name AS blocked_app
FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks blocking_locks
    ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
    AND blocking_locks.database IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.database
    AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation
    AND blocking_locks.page IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.page
    AND blocking_locks.tuple IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.tuple
    AND blocking_locks.virtualxid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.virtualxid
    AND blocking_locks.transactionid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.transactionid
    AND blocking_locks.classid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.classid
    AND blocking_locks.objid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objid
    AND blocking_locks.objsubid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objsubid
    AND blocking_locks.pid != blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
WHERE NOT blocked_locks.granted;

-- Wait events summary
SELECT
    wait_event_type,
    wait_event,
    count(*) as waiting_connections
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE wait_event IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY wait_event_type, wait_event
ORDER BY waiting_connections DESC;
```

### Table and Index Statistics

```sql
-- Table bloat and dead tuples
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as total_size,
    n_live_tup,
    n_dead_tup,
    round(n_dead_tup * 100.0 / NULLIF(n_live_tup + n_dead_tup, 0), 2) as dead_pct,
    last_vacuum,
    last_autovacuum,
    last_analyze,
    last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE n_live_tup > 1000
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;

-- Index usage and efficiency
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as size,
    CASE
        WHEN idx_scan = 0 THEN 'UNUSED'
        WHEN idx_tup_read = 0 THEN 'NEVER_READ'
        ELSE 'ACTIVE'
    END as status
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;

-- Sequential scans on large tables
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    seq_scan,
    seq_tup_read,
    idx_scan,
    n_live_tup,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE seq_scan > 0
  AND n_live_tup > 10000
  AND seq_tup_read / NULLIF(seq_scan, 0) > 10000
ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC;
```

### Database Statistics

```sql
-- Database size and activity
SELECT
    datname,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(datname)) as size,
    numbackends as connections,
    xact_commit,
    xact_rollback,
    round(xact_rollback * 100.0 / NULLIF(xact_commit + xact_rollback, 0), 2) as rollback_pct,
    blks_read,
    blks_hit,
    round(blks_hit * 100.0 / NULLIF(blks_hit + blks_read, 0), 2) as cache_hit_pct
FROM pg_stat_database
WHERE datname NOT IN ('template0', 'template1', 'postgres')
ORDER BY pg_database_size(datname) DESC;

-- Checkpoint and bgwriter statistics
SELECT
    checkpoints_timed,
    checkpoints_req,
    checkpoint_write_time,
    checkpoint_sync_time,
    buffers_checkpoint,
    buffers_clean,
    buffers_backend,
    buffers_alloc,
    round(100.0 * checkpoints_req / NULLIF(checkpoints_timed + checkpoints_req, 0), 2) as req_checkpoint_pct
FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;
